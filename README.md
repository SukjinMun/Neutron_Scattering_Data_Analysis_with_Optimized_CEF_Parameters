# Optimized__CEF_Parameters_for_Neutron_Scattering_Data_Analysis

The provided Jupyter code performs an in-depth analysis of neutron scattering data concerning Nd2Zr2O7 through the integration of crystal field theory. The process commences by initializing and converting crystal field parameters obtained from L'hotel $\textit{et al.}$, establishing essential values for subsequent computations. Across various stages, it juxtaposes theoretical spectra derived from L'hotel $\textit{et al.}$ with experimental data sourced from Sungkyun's dataset, assessing their congruence and discrepancies. Sungkyun's data undergoes background subtraction to isolate the signal of interest. Subsequently, the code utilizes diverse functions to fit theoretical spectra to experimental data, extracting peak positions and widths. Employing optimization techniques like scipy.optimize.shgo, it iteratively refines crystal field parameters, particularly B20, to improve alignment between calculated and observed energy spectra. The analysis culminates in informative visualizations presenting optimized spectra, peak positions, chi-squared values, and the correlation between B-parameters from L'hotel $\textit{et al.}$ and chi-squared values. This comprehensive approach provides a detailed exploration of Nd2Zr2O7's neutron scattering data within the framework of crystal field theory.
