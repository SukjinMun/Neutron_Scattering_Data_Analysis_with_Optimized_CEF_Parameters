The provided code within Jupyter Notebook conducts a thorough examination of neutron scattering data associated with a specific crystalline structure. This procedure employs crystal field theory to probe into the complexities of the material's behavior. The algorithm begins by initializing and converting crystal field parameters obtained from an external reference, ensuring that necessary values for subsequent computations are established. Throughout its execution, it compares theoretical spectra obtained from reference data with experimental datasets, assessing consistency and spotting discrepancies. Our dataset is subjected to background subtraction in order to identify the required signal. Following that, the algorithm uses a number of functions to fit the theoretical spectra to the experimental data, collecting important information such as peak positions and widths. It iteratively fine-tunes crystal field parameters using optimization techniques such as scipy.optimize.shgo, notably focused on enhancing alignment between estimated and observed energy spectra, with a specific emphasis on B20 refinement. This study culminates in instructive visualizations displaying optimized spectra, peak positions, chi-squared values, and the association between B-parameters and chi-squared values. This rigorous method allows for a thorough analysis of neutron scattering data within the realm of crystal field theory without revealing specific details about the molecule under investigation.
