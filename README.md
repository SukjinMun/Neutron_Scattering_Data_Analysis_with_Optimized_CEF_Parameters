# Optimized__CEF_Parameters_for_Neutron_Scattering_Data_Analysis

The Jupyter code presented conducts a comprehensive analysis of neutron scattering data for Nd${2}$Zr${2}$O${7}$ by integrating crystal field theory. It begins by initializing and converting crystal field parameters obtained from L'hotel $\textit{et al.}$, establishing necessary values for subsequent computations. Through various sections, it compares theoretical spectra derived from L'hotel $\textit{et al.}$ with experimental data from Sungkyun's dataset, evaluating their agreement and discrepancies. Background subtraction is performed on Sungkyun's data to isolate the signal of interest. Subsequently, the code fits theoretical spectra to experimental data using different functions and extracts peak positions and widths. Utilizing optimization techniques such as scipy.optimize.shgo, it refines crystal field parameters, particularly B20, to enhance agreement between calculated and observed energy spectra. The code concludes with insightful plots visualizing optimized spectra, peak positions, chi-squared values, and the relationship between B-parameters from L'hotel $\textit{et al.}$ and chi-squared values, providing a comprehensive analysis of Nd${2}$Zr${2}$O${7}$'s neutron scattering data within the framework of crystal field theory.
